  "script": "Whispers of massive footprints left in stone, stories of battles with beings as tall as the trees – giants have loomed over humanity's lore since time immemorial. But are these tales merely myths? Consider this: the conquistadors, hardened warriors that sailed the New World, chronicled their own encounters with towering tribes. What if what you've been told is all a lie? Follow to discover the truth. Across continents, legends of massive men persist, etched into the fabric of cultures. Artifacts too big for ordinary humans, and ancient engineering feats that baffle the modern mind. The loop of history brings us back, time and again, to question our past. Were the giants real, or just a symbol of a bygone era's cataclysms and dreams? In the end, we're left to ponder – could the truth be hiding in plain sight, in the shadow of these colossal tales? Join the quest to decipher whether we've been giants among history's pages.",
