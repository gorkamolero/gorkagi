  "text": "Have you ever heard the haunting whispers of ancient waters? Long ago, civilizations across the globe shared a chilling tale, a story of a great flood. In the heart of Mesopotamia, the epic of Gilgamesh spoke of rains that engulfed the world, a narrative eerily mirrored in the biblical story of Noah. Far in the icy realms of the Norse, they too whispered of a massive deluge where only two of every creature survived. Even the Maya, isolated in their majestic cities, foretold a flood sweeping away the old world. Each story, separated by oceans and centuries, shares an unexplained, sinister similarity. Were these mere myths? Or did they stem from a catastrophic event lost in time? Dive deep into the abyss of history with me, and we might just uncover the truth. Follow for more unsolved mysteries of the world. But beware, for the waters may pull us back to the beginning where the haunting whispers first began.",
