  "description": "Dive into the enigmatic tale of Atlantis, the legendary lost city. Was it mere myth or a submerged piece of history? Join us as we unearth Aristotle's skepticism and Krantor's quest for truth in ancient Egypt. What secrets did the ancient scrolls reveal to Krantor and do we dare accept them as truth? Follow to explore the hidden depths of history.",
  "script": "Imagine an advanced civilization, an island of unparalleled riches mentioned by Platoâ€”Atlantis. Aristotle scoffed, it was a fable. Yet, the historian Krantor was intrigued, embarking on an expedition to Egypt, craving evidence in ancient scripts. Whispers of a catastrophic event echoed through the scrolls... Was it a warning? Krantor's eyes widened as he pieced the clues together. As we retrace Krantor's steps, the line between myth and history blurs. We're drawn back to the beginning, to the moment Aristotle dismissed a legend. But as the loop closes, we're left wondering: has truth submerged beneath the waves of time? What if what you've been told is all a lie? Follow to discover the truth. ",
