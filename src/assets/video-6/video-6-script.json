  "description": "Dive into the enigma of a concept that exists without meaning. Can you unravel the mystery of the undefined? Watch now to challenge your reality!",
  "script": "What if I told you there was a word, a concept, lurking in the shadows of understanding, slipping away whenever you think you've grasped it? Undefined. It's everywhere, and yet nowhere—its essence always just out of reach. Pages upon pages, words upon words, all attempting to cage it within definitions, but it defies all. It's the map that leads you in circles, the riddle with no answer. And as you circle back to the beginning, asking yourself what it truly means, you realize—the answer is as elusive as the word itself. Undefined. And the question remains, echoing in the infinity of thought: 'What if what you've been told is all a lie? Follow to discover the truth.'",
