  "script": "In ancient Hindu texts, a cycle of time reveals itself â€“ the Yugas. Among them, the Kali Yuga stands, a dark age of turmoil and decline. Now, look around. Conflict, deception, disconnection. Could it be that we're living in the very age the sages warned us about? What if what you've been told is all a lie? Follow to discover the truth. The signs seem all too familiar: erosion of values, the fall of virtues, and a world seemingly in chaos. As whispers of the Kali Yuga pass like shadows over our modern civilization, do they merely reflect our fears, or are they the echo of an ancient truth circling back to us? This age, dark as it may be, is said to close full circle, marking the end, but also a rebirth. And with a chilling realization, we wonder, as the Kali Yuga turns, what age awaits us next?",
