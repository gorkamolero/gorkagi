  "text": "Imagine a world where Atlantis never sank, where pyramids were not tombs but beacons. Whispers say Hermes Trismegistus, the thrice great, knew the secret. He spoke of a timeless wisdom that connected the dots. What if the pyramids were a map? A map that leads to Atlantis? And what if, just what if, Hermes had unlocked this map? But every secret has its price, and some may be buried beneath the sea. Remember, not all lost cities want to be found, and as we seek, we must ask, will the waves reveal their secrets, or will they pull us into the depths? Atlantis calls, will you answer? Before you embark on this journey, hit like, share, and subscribe for more mysteries. Join us in unraveling the whispers of Atlantis.",
